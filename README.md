# Enzyme-Kinetics

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for analyzing enzyme kinetics data using various regression techniques. Enzyme kinetics studies the rate at which enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, often modeled using the Michaelis-Menten equation.

## Reaction Description
The dataset provided includes measurements of reaction rates (V) at different substrate concentrations (S). The goal is to fit the Michaelis-Menten model to this data and evaluate parameters such as the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) and Michaelis constant (Km).
